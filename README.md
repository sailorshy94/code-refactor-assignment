# Code Refactor Assignment

## Description

This project was completed in order to demonstrate proper knowledge of how to refactor code, how to structure html and CSS files according to proper semantics, and how to improve SEO for this website. This project was built to adhere to proper accessibility standards and to reduce the instances of repetitive code within the file. Changes were made that improved accessibility within the webpage, without making changes to the appearance of the page or it's functionality. The order and structure of the html and CSS files was also reorganized to reflect the edits made, and any broken links were repaired. The webpage was updated in order to improve SEO ranking, in addition to accessibility. 

Through the completion of this project, I learned how to implement the best practices for refactoring code, and the instances in which it is necessary versus unnecessary. This challenge also displayed to me the importance of tracking changes with inline commentary and frequent git add/commit actions. As I worked through this challenge I also gained a greater understanding of how CSS rules function, and how we as developers can use CSS to facilitate higher standards of accessiblity on websites. This project has helped me comprehend the large role that SEO plays within webpage success, and accessibility.
